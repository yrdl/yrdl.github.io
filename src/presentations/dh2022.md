blurb: "Quantifying representations of Asian Identity in 21st-century Anglophone Fiction for Young Readers"
---

This project investigates the portrayal of Asian diversity in Anglophone middle-school and YA novels between 2000 and 2020, tracking the frequency of proper nouns and adjectives referring to Asia and individual Asian countries. We examine dependency parses and hyphenated identities within the context of these frequencies.
