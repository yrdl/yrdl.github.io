blurb: "'Maturity' along various axes, with a focus on sex, risk factors & crude language."

This project considers "maturity" along various axes, with a focus on sex, "risk factors" like drugs and alcohol, and crude languageâ€”from potty language to swearing. What conclusions can we draw from co-occurances of words? What do they reveal about societal (and adult) concerns and priorities for young people, and our expectations for what they need and want in their literature?
